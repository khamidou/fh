fh, the feed handler                    

fh is a feed reader which is designed,
contrary to the more common feed readers,
to be used only from the command line.
It has no proper interface because it is
a collection of programs that work 
cooperatively.

Quick usage guide
=================

fh is for the moment, composed of three
programs :
fh-inc,	which downloads the feeds from
	the internet

fh-fetch, which selects feeds according
	  to a given pattern

fh-show, which display the feeds on the
	 screen

fh-fetch and fh-show are two different
programs because I wanted to give to 
the user the possibility of grepping an
input feed and still to be able to read
the whole feed.
