fh, the feed handler                    

fh is a feed reader which is designed,
contrary to the more common feed readers,
to be used only from the command line.
It has no proper interface because it is
a collection of programs that work 
cooperatively.

fh requires ruby and python. (I'm porting
it to python because of universal feed parser).

Quick usage guide
=================

fh is for the moment, composed of three
programs :
fh-inc,	which downloads the feeds from
	the internet

fh-fetch, which selects feeds according
	  to a given pattern

fh-show, which display the feeds on the
	 screen

fh-fetch and fh-show are two different
programs because I wanted to give to 
the user the possibility of grepping an
input feed and still to be able to read
the whole feed.

The fh-inc takes no arguments.
And reads a file named ~/.fh/feedlist
which contains one feed address per line.
fh-inc fetches the corresponding feed and
stores it in ~/.fh/feeds.

Here is a list of options that can be used
with fh-fetch:

fh-fetch from date [to date]
	 => fetches the feeds between two
	    dates. 
	    Note that by default, fh-fetch
	    gets the feeds created between
	    yesterday and today.

fh-fetch feeds "posix-regexp"
	 => selects only the feeds who match
	    posix-regexp

fh-fetch show [comma-separated-values]
	 => display only the elements 
	    corresponding to the specification
	    ex:
	    show feed-title,entry-title
	    will display only the title of each
	    feed and the title of each entry.

	    The available values are :
	    feed-title, entry-title, 
	    entry-contents
